# Deception

A social deduction game.

## Branch - MVP

Progress on the Minimum Viable Product.

### How to run this?:
Go to https://deception-game.herokuapp.com/!
**NOTE this is based on the hack branch, I'll switch it over eventually but for now just run this branch locally :)**

#### How to run it locally?

**If you run this locally please don't forget to change the port back to `process.env.PORT` before you push any changes!**

- install node from https://nodejs.org/en/
- in your terminal/cmd type node --version and make sure it returns something
- in your terminal, navigate to the `Team5` folder (or wherever you store the project files)
- run `npm install`
- in the `server.js` file change `const port` to = 3000.
- run `node server.js`
- in your browser, open up http://localhost:3000/ in a couple of different tabs.
- any movement should be reflected in the other tabs.
