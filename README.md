## Branch - hack

Progess on the first hack!

### How to run this?:
- install node from https://nodejs.org/en/
- in your terminal/cmd type node --version and make sure it returns something
- in your terminal, navigate to the `Team5` folder (or wherever you store the project files)
- run `npm install`
- run `node server.js`
- in your browser, open up http://localhost:3000/ in a couple of different tabs.
- any movement should be reflected in the other tabs.

_The chat box does nothing right now but I'm working on it!._
